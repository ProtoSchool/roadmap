# ProtoSchool OKRs Q4 2019

Items deemed most relevant to the work of the [IPFS Docs Task Force](https://github.com/ipfs/docs) are indicated under the IPFS Docs column.

_NOTE as of mid-quarter review: We've had to reallocate some time to onboarding and fixing a few bugs discovered in our error handling, so expect to drop some P2 items as a result. A few community-oriented tasks are still in need of volunteers in order to reach completion this quarter._

## Objective: The ProtoSchool website includes an increasing range of tutorial content from across multiple projects.
