**Mid-Quarter Notes:**
- We updated priorities mid-quarter, decreasing the priority of enabling libp2p content and potentially passing on Cypress updates this quarter in favor of focusing first on addressing the variety of issues caused by our routing and deployment strategies. This refocus is expected to improve traffic via improved SEO and social sharing options.
- Health issues and relocations that arose since our initial planning have necessitated increased time off for staffers, decreasing our capacity for the quarter.
