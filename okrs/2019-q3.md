# ProtoSchool OKRs Q3 2019

_NOTE: We'll be losing a core contributor to ProtoSchool on August 23, and some key results have been reprioritized or reassigned at our mid-quarter review to account for this change in our resources. Projected scores reflect the assumption that we will not have a replacement onboarded this quarter (or will have to reallocate significant time to onboarding)._

## Objective: The ProtoSchool website includes an increasing range of tutorial content from across multiple projects.
