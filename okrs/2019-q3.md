# ProtoSchool OKRs Q3 2019

_NOTE as of mid-quarter review: We'll be losing a core contributor to ProtoSchool on August 23, and some key results have been reprioritized or reassigned at our mid-quarter review to account for this change in our resources. Projected scores reflect the assumption that we will not have a replacement onboarded this quarter (or will have to reallocate significant time to onboarding)._

_NOTE as of end-of-quarter review: We gained a new core contributor on September 6 and are dedicating late-quarter time to onboarding in addition to our existing OKRs._

Items deemed relevant to the work of the [IPFS Docs Task Force](https://github.com/ipfs/docs) are indicated under the IPFS Docs column.

## Objective: The ProtoSchool website includes an increasing range of tutorial content from across multiple projects.
