**Updates**

Weekly updates are structured around our top-level goals as shared in our [project roadmap](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/roadmap#protoschool-roadmap). Please add updates on your work in the relevant section below.

-   [**Content Development**: The ProtoSchool website includes an increasing range of tutorial content from across multiple projects.](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/roadmap#content-development)

    -   (@zebateira) \[Completed] New “Anatomy of a CID” Tutorial published. Based on @alanshaw’s IPFS Camp workshop.

        -   Thank you to the reviewers: @mikeal @olizilla @alanshaw @ribasushi @johnnymatthews @terichadbourne @carlbordum
        -   Blog post:<https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-03-04-protoschool-tutorial-anatomy-of-a-cid/>
        -   Our first multiple-choice tutorial

    -   (@zebateira) \[Coming Soon] Update to “Mutable File System” Tutorial and “Regular Files API” to take into account the new major release from js-ipfs@0.41 which includes Async Iterables support.
    -   (@username) \[Completed / In Progress / Coming Soon] Your update here

-   [**Learner Experience**: The ProtoSchool website’s structure and design support a positive learning experience.](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/roadmap#learner-experience)

    -   The Anatomy of a CID tutorial is our first to use the multiple-choice format. You can hit a toggle on the tutorials page to hide coding challenges and reveal just our multiple-choice and text-based tutorials

-   [**Community Growth**: Chapter leaders are enabled to foster local learning communities around the globe.](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/roadmap#community-growth)

    -   We’ve just launched our new event-based (vs chapter-based) community model that reduces the burden on event organizers, adapts to a variety of formats, and makes ProtoSchool community growth more scalable. ProtoSchool name/logo now used exclusively for our content (workshops that teach our tutorials) as opposed to community groups.

        -  New [events page](https://proto.school/#/events) on website (built by @terichadbourne & @zebateira)
        - [Guide](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/blob/master/README.md) to the new event-based community leadership model

            -   No need to apply for a chapter
            -   Review our event guidelines and [submit a form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScL_QM2OWOBMs22tlmQ-us3xUrLEP0vvHYGP7NS8PMJh4rYhA/viewform) to add qualifying events to our website

        -   [Transition guide](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/blob/master/COMMUNITY_MODEL_UPDATE.md) with more context for those who led chapters under the old model

            -   You no longer need your chapter repo. Decide whether you’d like us to archive it or transfer its ownership to you before April 30, when we’ll be removing the chapters page from the website.
            -   [Subscribe to the newsletter](https://school.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=41e9e493c56c3865870435d91&id=967f7cf514) for local leadership updates, since we’ll no longer use GitHub as our primary means of communication. Encourage your attendees to subscribe for updates on new tutorials and site features.

        -   [Event resources](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/blob/master/RESOURCES.md), incl. Code of Conduct details

    -   Covid-19 will mean a slowdown in live events, so we don’t expect the events page to get a lot of use right away. Please note the guidelines of the World Health Organizations and your local health authorities before scheduling gatherings.

-   [**Project Management**: Internal structures position ProtoSchool for future growth.](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/roadmap#project-management)
