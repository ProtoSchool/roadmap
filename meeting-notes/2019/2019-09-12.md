**Updates**

Weekly updates are structured around our top-level goals as shared in our [project roadmap](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/roadmap#protoschool-roadmap). Please add updates on your work in the relevant section below.

-   [**Content Development**: The ProtoSchool website includes an increasing range of tutorial content from across multiple projects.](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/roadmap#content-development)
    -   @terichadbourne is continuing to explore the content from IPFS Camp to see what could be recycled to create new ProtoSchool tutorials or add to existing ones. As a first step, sheâ€™s gathered up slide decks and made them more prominent in the IPFS camp repo. You can now find links to many of the slide decks from core and elective courses in the [readme](https://github.com/ipfs/camp/blob/master/README.md) there.
    -   @sericaia submitted her first PR (ðŸŽ‰), fixing the provided code for MFS Lesson 10
        -   <https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/pull/294>
    -   @nukemandan found a bug in MFS Lesson 4 a while back that might actually be a bug in IPFS. @terichadbourne is now coordinating with @achingbrain for some detective work.
