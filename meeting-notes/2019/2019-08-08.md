    -   @terichadbourne & @fsdiogo are working on adding analytics features to help us understand user behavior and make informed choices for future content. So far we’ve implemented analytics for links clicked to reach external resources and lessons passed. Next up: tutorials passed, number of failed submissions and resets of code.

**Discussion Highlights**

_Discussion highlights and additional notes._

-   _Updates from @kk3wong:_

    -   _The [book about IPFS in simplified Chinese](https://item.m.jd.com/product/53102580564.html), written by Tianyi Dong and Jaile Dai, has now been published. Masa Onion may work on a Japanese translation of the book and Kevin may work on an English one._
    -   _Kevin will be at the [Web3 Summit](https://web3summit.com/) in Berlin next week._
    -   _There are some blockchain folks in China who are intersted in starting a Web3 community in China to support education._

-   _Translation Discussion_

    -   _Kevin asked if it’s possible to add translations to the IPFS website. Teri shared that while the system isn’t yet built to handle translations, there’s an [open issue](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/protoschool.github.io/issues/268) that folks can subscribe to if they’re interested in knowing when that becomes possible. ProtoSchool is still quite a bit in flux under the hood, which is why we feel it makes sense to let the platform stabilize before reworking it to be translation-friendly. Ultimately we think it would be great to make it work with Transifex so volunteers can offer translations for the website content._
    -   _In the meantime, we encourage hosts of chapter events to feel free to create slide decks in their local languages, as the Shanghai chapter recently did when sharing our Decentralized Data Structures tutorial._
    -   _You can learn about contributing to other IPFS resources [here](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#translations)._
