# ProtoSchool Roadmap

## The ProtoSchool Vision

To make it easy to get started with decentralized web technologies.


## Guiding Principles

-   ProtoSchool’s self-paced online tutorials are **beginner-friendly**. (Advanced content is presented only when we have intermediate content in place to provide **scaffolding** that bridges the content gap.)
-   ProtoSchool offers a **cohesive** and **consistently-formatted** set of tutorials for learning about the decentralized web. (It doesn’t serve as a catch-all for all formats of educational content.)
-   Local, **self-governing community groups** provide the opportunity for learners to explore our tutorials at **live events** with **support from mentors**.
-   Online tutorials, local events, and online discussions provide a **welcoming and inclusive environment** for all community members.


## Top-Level Goals

- [**Content Development:** The ProtoSchool website includes an increasing range of tutorial content from across multiple projects.](#content-development)
