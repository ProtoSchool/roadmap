# ProtoSchool Roadmap

## The ProtoSchool Vision

To make it easy to get started with decentralized web technologies.


## Guiding Principles

-   ProtoSchool’s self-paced online tutorials are **beginner-friendly**. (Advanced content is presented only when we have intermediate content in place to provide **scaffolding** that bridges the content gap.)
-   ProtoSchool offers a **cohesive** and **consistently-formatted** set of tutorials for learning about the decentralized web. (It doesn’t serve as a catch-all for all formats of educational content.)
-   A **growing community** of local, **self-governing** ProtoSchool chapters provide the opportunity for learners to explore our tutorials at **live events** with **support from mentors**.
-   Online tutorials, local events, and chapter discussions provide a **welcoming and inclusive environment** for all community members.


## Top-Level Goals

## Roadmap
This proposed execution path represents our best intentions, and is subject to refinement and improvement as the needs and capacity of the project change over time.

More tightly defined objectives and key results (OKRs) for the immediate future can be found in our [Q3 2019 OKRs](./okrs/2019-q3.md). See our [meeting notes](./meeting-notes/meeting-notes-and-recordings.md) or join our next [ProtoSchool Weekly Call](https://github.com/ProtoSchool/organizing/issues/47) for progress updates.
